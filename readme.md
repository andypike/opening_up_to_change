# Opening up to change

This is the source code for the project I showed during my talk at Arrrrcamp in
2015.

It shows how you can create self-registering classes in a Rails application
which allow you to add new features without changing existing code.

Slides for this talk can be found here: https://speakerdeck.com/andypike/opening-up-to-change
